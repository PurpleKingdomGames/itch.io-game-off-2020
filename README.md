# Moonshot

Our entry into the [Game Off 2020](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020) game jam!

[Play here!](https://purplekingdomgames.github.io/itch.io-game-off-2020/)

## Aim of the game

This is a simple Thrust / Lander style game in which you must launch your rocket from your back yard and try to land it on the moon.

The controls are your keyboard arrow keys:

- Use **Up** to thrust
- Use **Left** & **Right** to rotate the ship

That's it!

## Our Entry

The game jam's theme was "Moonshot", and in some ways our entire entry was a Moonshot!

This was our first game jam working together, we used our own custom engine [Indigo](http://indigoengine.io/), and wrote the whole thing in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/). We had many grand plans for the game that we inevitably had to pair back just make the submission deadline!! :-)

So this isn't the game we intended ...but we had a good time building it and we're quite pleased with how it came together! We've learned a lot from the experience, and have a pile of Indigo engine improvement tickets to work on as a result.
